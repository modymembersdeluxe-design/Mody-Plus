# Mody+ Video Generator Plan

## Purpose
This document captures the creative intent behind a Mody+ remix that blends YTP/YTPMV techniques with multi-era editing styles, while remaining focused on outputting a Mody+ only release that can be packaged for GitHub.

## Creative Inputs
- **Source material**: Collect clips, stingers, and recognizable lines from the Mody+ channel.
- **Era styling**:
  - 1990s: VHS artifacts, scan lines, analog noise.
  - 2000s: Flash-era pacing, hard cuts, animated text.
  - 2010s: EDM-driven YTPMV rhythms, pitch-shifted phrases.
  - 2020s: Hyper-edits, speed ramps, heavy transitions.
- **Remix flavors**: Slow loops, chaotic stutters, and full-speed cutdowns.

## Edit Checklist
1. **Organize source**: Tag clips by era, meme references, and core beats.
2. **Audio first pass**: Build a base rhythm (kick/snare or beatbed) to anchor the chaos.
3. **Video pass**: Match the visual stutters to the beat, swap shots for contrast.
4. **3D insertions**: Add 3D elements where the beat hits or chorus shifts.
5. **Polish**: Title cards, end slates, and GitHub release notes.

## Output Targets
- **Mody+ only render** (final video file).
- **Sony Vegas project** (editable timeline).
- **GitHub release bundle** (video, changelog, asset list).

## Notes for Collaboration
- Confirm the exact Mody+ format requirements before final export.
- Track all third-party audio to avoid copyright conflicts.
